# AI-Based Food Order System

The **AI-Based Food Order System** is a Laravel-powered web application developed to offer personalized food recommendations based on users' **Body Mass Index (BMI)**. Designed to promote healthier eating habits, the system features an **AI agent** that analyzes user BMI data to suggest balanced meal options tailored to individual health needs. Beyond simple food ordering, the AI considers **nutritional values**, **portion sizes**, and **dietary preferences**, ensuring users receive recommendations that align with their wellness goals. The platform seamlessly integrates with restaurant menus, allowing users to place orders directly while receiving health-conscious suggestions, creating a smarter and more personalized food ordering experience.
